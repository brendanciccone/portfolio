                <p>
                  At the core of our platform was the Virtual Reality Viewer, immersing healthcare professionals as if
                  they were in the operating room. These were not simulations. When users donned a VR headset, they'd
                  view live medical procedures and engage with peers in real-time from across the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Navigating the landscape of VR design was daunting at times, as established norms and testing
                  challenges were present. Despite this, we designed a template that allowed us to rapidly iterate in
                  Sketch or Figma and bring those designs into VR with nearly perfect placement and scaling.

                <p>
                  I worked closely with the co-founders and internal and external users while building interfaces for
                  mobile, web, and VR platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One initial challenge was streamlining event creation and management. While some issues, like user
                  metrics and basic event management capabilities, were obvious, others were more ambiguous, such as
                  merging multiple user workflows or making certain features accessible to non-technical users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based on our research, we decided to segment functionalities based on user roles in one unified
                  dashboard. The admin dashboard freed up resources and empowered internal and external users to manage
                  events, headsets, organizations, and more.

                <p>
                  I noticed recurring issues while collaborating with customer success where users struggled to access
                  events. Initially, it appeared to be an authentication user flow issue. I eventually discovered the
                  core problem: joining events in a headset requires more steps than many of our users had the time to
                  complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make joining an event seamless, I introduced a web-based interface, allowing live event access on
                  any device with a browser. It was a technical feat, as our incredible engineering team managed to take
                  live video initially meant for VR and display it perfectly on a 2D screen. This shift minimized the
                  hassles of headset distribution and simplified event access while allowing for flexibility between VR
                  and web-based experiences.

                  Working with new technology is not easy, but it presents challenges that keep you interested in ways
                  other products may not. Combine that with the healthcare focus, and I felt I had an inherent reason
                  for solving the problems we were working on.

                  While I learned a lot about startups in the early days of the company, I think my biggest lesson was
                  one that can apply to nearly any role at any company: you may have the correct answer or idea, but how
                  you present it and when you present it matters almost as much as whether it's right or wrong.
